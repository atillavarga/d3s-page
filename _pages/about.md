My name is Atilla Varga and I am a Chemistry MSc graduate from the [Barry Lab](https://carleton.ca/barrylab/). As a results driven R&D engineer with a passion for innovation, I have a proven track record of 6+ years of `process development`, equipment innovation and device fabrication. From leading the development of novel material processes to new equipment integration, I excel at tackling complex technical challenges. 

I'm also an entrepreneur, having founded a successful 3D printing and prototyping business, where I established efficient operations and cultivated strong client relationships. 

My research background includes chemical synthesis, material and process development, further solidifying my technical foundation. 

Throughout my career, I've collaborated with cross-functional teams, presented research internationally, and even developed patent-pending solutions. I seek to help advance humanity towards a more sustainable future, where semiconductor technology plays a pivotal role in addressing global challenges.
